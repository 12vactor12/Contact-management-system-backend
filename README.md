# Code Style Guidelines for Flask Backend

This document outlines the coding standards for the backend development of the contact management system. The standards are based on the following sources:
- PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Flask Official Documentation (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)

## 1. General Guidelines

- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces per indentation level).
- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.
- Use comments to explain code logic, but avoid obvious comments.

## 2. Naming Conventions

### Variables and Functions
- Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
- Function names should be descriptive and indicate their action, e.g., `def create_contact():`.

### Classes
- Use `CamelCase` for class names, e.g., `ContactManager`.

### Constants
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants, e.g., `MAX_CONTACTS`.

## 3. Imports

- Organize imports in the following order:
  1. Standard library imports.
  2. Related third-party imports.
  3. Local application/library-specific imports.
  
- Use one import per line. Example:
  ```python
  import os
  import sys
  from flask import Flask, request
  ```

## 4. Flask-Specific Guidelines

- Create a `config.py` file to manage configuration settings.
- Use Flask's built-in functions for routing:
  ```python
  @app.route('/contacts', methods=['GET'])
  def get_contacts():
      pass
  ```

- Use `Blueprints` to organize routes in larger applications.
- Handle errors with Flask's error handlers, e.g.:
  ```python
  @app.errorhandler(404)
  def not_found(error):
      return {'message': 'Not found'}, 404
  ```

## 5. Documentation

- Use docstrings to describe all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
- Follow the convention of triple quotes for multiline docstrings.
  ```python
  def get_contact(contact_id):
      """
      Retrieve a contact by ID.
      
      :param contact_id: ID of the contact.
      :return: Contact details.
      """
      pass
  ```

## 6. Testing

- Write unit tests for all functions and endpoints.
- Use the `unittest` framework or `pytest`.
- Organize tests in a separate `tests` directory.

## 7. Version Control

- Use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.
- Follow the practice of committing code frequently with small changes.

## 8. Security Practices

- Always validate and sanitize user input.
- Use Flask's built-in mechanisms for handling sessions and CSRF protection.

## Conclusion

Following these guidelines will help ensure that the codebase is clean, maintainable, and consistent. For more details, refer to the official PEP 8 and Flask documentation.
